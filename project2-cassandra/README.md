# Introduction
In this project, I will complete ETL pipelines and data modeling techiniques with Apache Cassandra. 

I will model the data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. As part of the ETL pipeline, a set of CSV files within a directory will be used to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

# How to run? 

1) Ensure Cassandra running on localhost.

2) Install jupyter

`pip3 install jupyter`

3) Use jupyter to run a project notebook

`jupyter notebook Project_1B_Project.ipynb`
